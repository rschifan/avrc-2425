First proposed by Raghavan, Albert, and Kumara in 2007, it relies on a simple yet effective principle: nodes in a network tend to belong to the same communities as the majority of their neighbors.\n",

    "1. **Initialization**: Each node is assigned a unique label (typically its node ID)\n",
    "2. **Propagation**: In random order, each node adopts the label that appears most frequently among its neighbors\n",

    "3. **Convergence**: Step 2 is repeated until each node has the same label as the majority of its neighbors\n",

    "## 5. Analysis of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations from Multiple Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the multiple runs, the Label Propagation algorithm produces different results each time. This is due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random node ordering**: The algorithm processes nodes in random order during each iteration\n",
    "2. **Random tie-breaking**: When a node has equal numbers of neighbors with different labels, one is chosen randomly\n",
    "3. **Convergence paths**: Different initial random decisions lead to different paths toward convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with Ground Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual Karate Club split into two communities (around nodes 0 and 33). Our LPA runs may detect:\n",
    "- More than 2 communities (over-partitioning)\n",
    "- Exactly 2 communities that may not perfectly match the real split\n",
    "- Communities that generally separate the two leaders (administrator and instructor)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Speed**: Label propagation is extremely fast, even on larger networks\n",
    "2. **Simplicity**: The algorithm requires no parameters or prior knowledge\n",
    "3. **Variability**: Results can vary between runs\n",
    "4. **Practical use**: For robust results, it's often recommended to run LPA multiple times and either:\n",
    "   - Select the most common partition\n",
    "   - Construct a consensus partition\n",
    "   - Use the run with the highest quality score (e.g., modularity)"

    "### Variations of Label Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semi-supervised Label Propagation**\n",
    "   - Some nodes have fixed, known labels from the beginning\n",
    "   - These \"seed\" labels propagate to unlabeled nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted Label Propagation**\n",
    "   - Labels of neighbors connected by stronger edges have more influence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speaker-Listener Label Propagation (SLPA)**\n",
    "   - Allows nodes to have multiple labels\n",
    "   - Better captures overlapping communities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Label Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-deterministic results**\n",
    "   - Different runs can produce different communities\n",
    "   - Solutions depend on random node ordering and tie-breaking\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stability issues**\n",
    "   - The algorithm may oscillate between solutions in some networks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resolution limit**\n",
    "   - May struggle to detect small communities in large networks\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simple decision rule**\n",
    "   - The majority voting mechanism is simple but may miss subtle community structures\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Label Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Label propagation is an excellent choice when:\n",
    "- You need a fast, scalable algorithm for large networks\n",
    "- You don't have prior knowledge about the number of communities\n",
    "- The community structure is relatively clear\n",
    "- You can afford to run the algorithm multiple times"
